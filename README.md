# Aura

Aura is a decoupled, event-driven architecture for developing widget-based applications. It takes advantage of patterns and best practices for developing maintainable applications and gives you greater control over widget-based development. Aura gives you complete control of a widget's lifecycle, allowing developers to dynamically start, stop, reload and clean-up parts of their application as needed.

## Concepts

### The `Aura` object

Your application will be an instance of the `Aura` object.

Its responsibilities are to load extensions when the app starts and clean them up when the app stops.

### Extension

An extension are loaded in your application when it starts. They allow you to add features to your app. Those are available to the widgets through their `sandbox`.

### Core

The `core` implements aliases for DOM manipulation, templating and other lower-level utilities that pipe back to a library of choice. Aliases allow you to switch libraries with minimum impact on your application.

### Sandbox

A `sandbox` is just way to implement the facade pattern on top of features provided by `core`. It allow you to expose the parts of JavaScript library that are safe to use instead of exposing the entire API. This is particularly useful when working in teams.

When your app starts, it will create an instance of `sandbox` in each of your widgets.

### Widget

A widget represents an unit of a page. Each widget is independant that mean that they know nothing about each other. To make them communicate, Publish/Subscribe can be used.

## Getting started

### Building Aura.js

### Creating an Application

The first step in creating an Aura application is to make an instance of `Aura`.

    var app = new Aura();

Now that we have your `app`, we can start it.

	app.start({
	  widget: "body"
	});

This starts the app by saying that it should search widgets everywhere in the `body` of your HTML document.

### Creating a Widget

By default widgets are looked after in a directory called `widgets/` that should be at the same level as your HTML document.

Let's say that we want to create an "hello" widget. To do that we need to create a `hello/` directory in the `widgets/`.

This directory should contains:

- A `main.js` file. It will bootstrap and describe the widget. It is mandatory, no matter how small it can be.
- All the other files that your widget needs (models, templates, â€¦).

For our "hello" widget the `main.js` will be:

    define({
      initialize: function() {
        this.$el.html("<h1>Hello Aura</h1>");
      }
    });

### Declaring a Widget

Add the following code to your HTML document.

    <div data-aura-widget="hello"></div>

Aura will call the `initialize` method that we have defined in `widgets/hello/main.js`.
